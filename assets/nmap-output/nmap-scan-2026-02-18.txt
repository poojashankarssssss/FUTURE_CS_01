=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===

1. DISABLE SERVER VERSION DISCLOSURE
   - Suppress Apache version in headers
   - Remove X-Powered-By header revealing PHP version

2. UPDATE SERVER SOFTWARE
   - Consider PHP 8.0+ for better security
   - Review Apache security advisories

3. CONFIGURE SECURITY HEADERS
   - HSTS not detected
   - CSP not detected
   - X-Frame-Options not detected

4. MONITOR OPEN PORTS
   - Current configuration appears minimal
   - Keep only necessary services active
