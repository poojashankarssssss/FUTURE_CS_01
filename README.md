# Vulnerability Assessment Report - Task 1

## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive **Vulnerability Assessment Report** for a live website, conducted using industry-standard security tools and passive testing methodologies. The assessment identifies, classifies, and provides remediation guidance for discovered security risks.

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✔ Detect common web vulnerabilities
- ✔ Categorize risks by severity (Low/Medium/High)
- ✔ Translate technical findings into business language
- ✔ Provide actionable remediation steps for each issue
- ✔ Deliver professional assessment documentation

## 🛠️ Tools & Methodology

### Tools Used
- **Nmap** - Network reconnaissance and service enumeration
- **OWASP ZAP (Passive Scan)** - Passive web application security scanning
- **Browser DevTools** - Client-side vulnerability identification
- **Canva** - Professional report design and visualization

### Assessment Approach
- **Passive Testing**: Non-intrusive scanning to avoid disrupting target systems
- **Manual Code Review**: Browser DevTools inspection for client-side issues
- **Industry Standards**: OWASP Top 10 framework and CVSS scoring methodology
